    bio: "Currently committed to research in Machine learning as an undergraduate with experience in web3, parallel computing, and mobile app development. Eager contributions to Whats the word, in efforts to assist production-ready applications.",
    ML: "Implemented linear regressions and support vector machine regressions to determine the Ùè∞Ä parameter for the Pythagorean theorem of baseball for a given MLB team. Used Markov chain to calculate the expected number of runs against and runs scored for a given MLB team to be used to the calculate the team's winning percent Participated in weekly meetings, code reviews, demos, design instruction Practiced Machine Learning Techniques: Gradient Descent, Markov Chain simulations Wrote and reviewed technical documentation using LaTex, for a peer reviewed journal. Programmed applications and tools using object-oriented languages with goals of code abstraction, stability and reuse.",
    High_Performance: "Implemented a hybrid MPI+OpenMP Approach allowed for easy work load distribution allowing to save time Able to decrease the Time complexity by implementing Master-Worker algorithm. Constructed a visualization of run times, and speeds using TAU Performance analyzer, and excel.", 
    Blockchain: "Developed a Blockchain data structure, with a Proof of Work consensus. Implemented a Wallet feature that can create transactions on the blockchain, while keeping track of UTXOs."
